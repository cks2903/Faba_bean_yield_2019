# Faba_bean_yield_2019

This repository includes an R-script used to perform yield analyses on 17 different commercial cultivars of faba beans.

The analyses include:

-LMM on yield to predict cultivar effects on yields (BLUPs) and estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by different components
-Analyses of yield stability of different cultivars
-Analyses of protein and yield trade-off including the genetic correlation between these traits and measurs of protein yield stability.
